                I am a beginner programmer that is currently focused on learning JavaScript. I am persuing a career in
                Software
                Development after leaving my job in accounting. I went to school at the University of North Carolina at
                Asheville where I received a degree is Accounting. I moved to Chicago after graduation and started
                working at a
                global insurance firm in their accounting department. I worked their for a year and decided that career
                was not
                the correct one for me and decided to persue software development. I learned many soft skills from my
                accounting
                work that are simillar and highly transferable to my work in software development.
